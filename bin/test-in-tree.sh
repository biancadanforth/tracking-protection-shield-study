# This script automates the process of testing your Shield study addon locally
# for a given unit test.
# It takes the state of your addon's working directory in your GitHub repo and
# drops it into your local Firefox development directory. You do not need to
# commit any changes in Git or Hg to perform local testing.

# IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE USING - ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THIS SCRIPT TO WORK
# **You have added your shield study ID to the list of DIRS in ./browser/extensions/moz.build in the Hg repo
# **You have a jar.mn and moz.build file inside your ./addon folder in your Git repo
# You are testing against the "release" channel
# You have recently built the "release" branch of Firefox
#   (`hg pull -u release` > [`./mach clobber`] > `./mach build`)
#   in your local Firefox directory
# Your local Firefox directory is located at: $FIREFOX_LOCAL_DIR
#  If not, update the value of that variable in this script.
# The unit test you want to run is located at: $UNIT_TEST_RELATIVE_PATH
#  If not, update the value of that variable in this script.

# Step 1: Copying build-includes into dist/${ADDON_NAME}/ for testing in tree

# Step 3: Change directories in the terminal to location for mozilla-unified
pushd ${FIREFOX_LOCAL_DIR} > /dev/null

# Step 4: Fetch latest changes from branch of interest, e.g. release
echo "NPM RUN TEST: Fetching latest changes for the release branch of Firefox..."

# Step 5: Build Firefox with this patch
echo "NPM RUN TEST: Building a local copy of Firefox..."

# Step 7: Change directories back to GitHub repo
